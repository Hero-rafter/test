1.Can we nest the Scaffold widget? Why or Why not?
=> Yes, We can nest scaffold widget, but it is not necessary to nest Scaffold widget.
Because the Scaffold was designed to be the single top level container for a MaterialApp,
and thus it is typically not necessary to nest scaffolds.


2.What are the different ways we can create a custom widget ?
=> We create Custom Widgets when we want a custom look and feel to our app.
We can create custom widgets by using flutter's Stateless and Stateful widget.

3.How can I access platform(iOS or Android) specific code from Flutter?
=> We can access platform specific code using Method channels in flutter.
Method channel provides us a bridge by which we can give call to block of code written in platform specific language.(Android: Java or kotlin, iOS: Objective-C or swift)
After performing specific platform specific operation, method channel can be used to give reverse callback also from platform specific side to flutter.

4.What is BuildContext? What is its importance?
=> BuildContext is a locator that is used to track each widget in a tree and locate them and their position in the tree.
The BuildContext of each widget is passed to their build method.
Each BuildContext is unique to a widget.
This means that the BuildContext of a widget is not the same as the BuildContext of the widgets returned by the widget.
